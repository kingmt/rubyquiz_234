234 Random Points within a Circle

Description

Generating random numbers is a useful feature and Ruby provides us with
Kernel.rand to generate numbers uniformly distributed between zero and one. If
we want to generate random numbers with other distributions, then weâ€™ll need to
do a little work. The quiz this week is to generate random points uniformly
distributed within a circle of a given radius and position.
